"""
Non-Sequential Single-Task (NSST) utilities for SuTraN.

This package hosts the encoder-only SuTraN variants that focus on scalar
targets such as remaining runtime, binary outcome, and multiclass outcome.
It includes the model definition, training and inference helpers, dataset
subset utilities, and metric implementations used to build strong scalar
baselines alongside the multi-task SuTraN+ models.
