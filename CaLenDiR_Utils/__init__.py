Utilities for CaLenDiR (Case Length Distribution-Reflective) training.

This package collects helper modules used to mitigate case-length bias in
SuTraN and baseline models: Uniform Case-Based Sampling, suffix-length
normalized loss functions, and the weighted metric routines needed to
compute CaLenDiR's case-based evaluation scores.
