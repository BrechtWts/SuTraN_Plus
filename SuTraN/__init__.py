"""
SuTraN+ core package.

Builds on the original SuTraN architecture of Wuyts et al. [1]_, whose
reference implementation is publicly documented at
https://github.com/BrechtWts/SuffixTransformerNetwork. This package
extends that foundation with the shared SuTraN+ Transformer (`SuTraN.py`),
equal-weighted and adaptive (UW, GradNorm, PCGrad) training procedures,
composite loss builders, and inference utilities used in “Unifying
Multi-Task Process Prediction with Adaptive Loss Strategies in
Transformers.”
